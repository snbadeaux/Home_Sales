# Home_Sales

Through the use of PySpark and SparkSQL, the aim of this assignment was to determine key metrics about home sales.<br>
After using Spark to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temp table, the next aim was to compare run times of the same queries.<br>

## Findings
1. What is the average price for a four-bedroom house sold for each year? Round off your answer to two decimal places.
2.	What is the average price of a home for each year it was built that has three bedrooms and three bathrooms? Round off your answer to two decimal places.
3.	What is the average price of a home for each year that has three bedrooms, three bathrooms, two floors, and is greater than or equal to 2,000 square feet? Round off your answer to two decimal places.
4.	What is the "view" rating for homes costing more than or equal to $350,000? Determine the run time for this query, and round off your answer to two decimal places.
5.	Using the cached data, run the query that filters out the view ratings with an average price of greater than or equal to $350,000. Determine the runtime and compare it to the uncached runtime.
6.	Run the query that filters out the view ratings with an average price of greater than or equal to $350,000. Determine the runtime and compare it to the uncached runtime.
